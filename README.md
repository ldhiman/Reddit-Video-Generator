# Reddit Video Generator
---
This program generates a .mp4 video automatically by querying the top post on the
r/askreddit subreddit, and grabbing several comments. The workflow of this program is:
- Save or Download the File at `D:\Python\RedditVideoGenerator`, for custom path, you need to edit fie path in the programs
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create Folder named as `BackgroundVideos`, `OutputVideos`, `Screenshots`, `Voiceovers`

Now, you can run `python main.py` to be prompted for which post to choose. Alternatively,
you can run `python main.py <reddit-post-id>` to create a video for a specific post.
